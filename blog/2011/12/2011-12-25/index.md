저는 기독교인은 아니지만, 그래도 오늘은 크리스마스. 누군가는 행복하게, 누군가는 괴롭게 오늘을 보내고 있겠죠.

<!-- truncate -->

우리는 누구를 위해 올 한 해를 보낸 걸까요. 스스로를 위해서? 혹은 누군가를 위해서? 그것도 아님 그 어떤 다른 것을 위해서?

우리가 한 해 동안 해온 일들이 혹시 우리를 더 딱딱하게 만들었다고 하더라도, 혹은 한 해 동안 길을 잃고 헤메였던 것 같은 기분이 들더라도, 그게 잠시일 뿐이길 기원합니다. 그리고 내일부터는 새로운 날들이, 더 좋은 날들이 펼쳐지기를 바랄게요.

Hallelujah

by Jeff Buckley

Well I heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
Well it goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah


Well Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
she tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah


Well baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah


Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do you?
And remember when I moved in you?
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah


Well maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who'd out drew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen in the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
